## Liquid Democracy DAO Template

This is a template for creating Liquid Democracy DAOs on Aragon.
Each Liquid Democracy DAO consists of one or more voting apps (allowing organizations to segment voters into 'Departments' with distinct responsibilities within the org).  Voters have the option to vote directly on issues relevant to their Department(s) or delegate their voting power to trusted third-parties.
